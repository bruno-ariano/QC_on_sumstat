# QC_on_sumstat

### Work in progress

Quality control step to do GWAS summary statistics databases such as GWAS-catalog, FINNGEN, etc..

The first part consist in estimating the priors for each test. I have already calculated these for UK Biobanks and are reported below:

#### AF-AF test:

#### mean beta test:
3rd_quartile_beta_prior = 

3rd_quartile_intercept_prior = 

3rd_quartile_se_prior = 


#### P-Z test:
3rd_quartile_beta_prior = 

3rd_quartile_intercept_prior = 

3rd_quartile_se_prior = 


#### SE-N test:
3rd_quartile_beta_prior = 

3rd_quartile_intercept_prior = 

3rd_quartile_se_prior =
